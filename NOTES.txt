- DATA
1. Image dataset of different yoga positions (png, jpg)
FIRST: extract keypoints (N) as x, y adjacent columns running mediapipe on all the images

- DESIGN MODEL
1. Classifier model - as they did in the Kaggle notebook (these were trained on pixel images, but now we have coordinates)
2. (optionally, try using the classification method for depthAI)

- TRAIN MODEL
1. Train classifier on the keypoint coordinate dataset

- EVALUATE
1. Run inference on still images
2. Add result display to real time camera
